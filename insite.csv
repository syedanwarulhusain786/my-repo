 Antibody and protein biotherapeutics are changing the way physicians treat autoimmune diseases, asthma, and cancer. At Xencor, we apply proprietary protein engineering technologies to develop better biotherapeutics â€“ antibodies that target new biological mechanisms and are more potent, safer and longer lasting â€“ to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.
 
 Our XmAb antibody engineering technology dramatically augments natural antibody immune functions while maintaining over 99.5% identity to natural antibodies. This combination of new, highly potent activities while maintaining the beneficial drug features and simplicity of natural antibodies allows us to create differentiated drug candidates with potential for breakthrough performance. The XmAbÂ® platform has resulted in a robust pipeline of antibody product candidates, including eight in human clinical trials being developed by Xencor and by pharmaceutical partners.

 Level 10 is one company, everything IT. With increasing IT challenges, we recognize retailers need less partners to do more. By strategically bundling our services - hardware procurement, asset management, maintenance, in-field technician support and service desk - we act as an extension of retailers'â€‹ IT teams throughout their technology & mobile deployments, store openings/closing/remodels, and in-store support work. 
 
 Our History
 
 We began as a business focused on Point-of-Sale (POS) hardware procurement in 2001 under the name tekservePOS. We found incredible success in this and became certified partners with over 45 OEMs. However, over the years, as the marketplace evolved and retail IT professionals were challenged to do more with less, we committed ourselves to increasing our value to our customers with a full range of services that compliment their hardware needs. Simply put, we became more than just a POS hardware reseller and, as a result, our name was no longer reflective of who we were as a company. Therefore, we have rebranded ourselves as Level 10, effective March 1, 2014.

 To create solutions that allow for an easy and enjoyable work life.

 Thatâ€™s how we described ourselves in 1997, and that mission hasnâ€™t changed and will never, ever change. For over two decades weâ€™ve worked to make the Alamo Drafthouse experience the best cinematic experience in the world. Hereâ€™s how.
 
 We donâ€™t just want to be another multiplex. Everyone who works at Alamo Drafthouse, from the managers to the servers to the kitchen staff, is passionate about film.
 
 To us, the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe can be just as worthy of attention and celebration as a foreign language drama. Through our Drafthouse Recommends program we've committed ourselves to helping innovative and challenging films like GET OUT, THE FLORIDA PROJECT, and CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, and find an audience.
 
 Celebrating classic cinema is also something we take seriously. Whether itâ€™s an interactive Movie Party presentation of a timeless classic, a chef-inspired feast with a menu paired to a film, or a re-evaluation of a lost gem, we love sharing the movies we love with Alamo Drafthouse audiences of all ages.
 
 When you see a movie at Alamo Drafthouse, you get cold drinks, delicious meals and tasty local beers, brought to your seat by a server. Need a free refill on your popcorn or soda? Raise an order card and weâ€™ll get it taken care of quickly.
 
 Each Alamo Drafthouse's menu has food, snacks & dessert prepared fresh from locally sourced ingredients. Plus, our chefs regularly create special menus inspired by classic cinema and big upcoming blockbusters, like an all-Pakistani menu curated by Kumail Nanjiani for THE BIG SICK or a take on African flavors for BLACK PANTHER.
 
 Beer is our middle name at Alamo Drafthouse, so we make certain that every Alamo Drafthouse location highlights and promotes the best local craft breweries. Our bar staff also loves to innovate, and are constantly mixing up new cocktail creations thatâ€™ll elevate the cinematic experience.",2,7,20,1595,162356

The one-time procedure is done by bronchoscopy and requires no cutting or incisions. During the procedure, on average 4 tiny valves are placed in the airways to block off the diseased parts of the lung which allows trapped air to escape until the lobe is reduced. Reducing hyperinflation allows the healthier parts of the lungs to expand and take in more air. This results in patients being able to breathe easier and have less shortness of breath.1 
 
 Complications of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve treatment can include but are not limited to pneumothorax, worsening of COPD symptoms, hemoptysis, pneumonia, dyspnea and, in rare cases, death.1

 A post-pollution world is inevitable.
 Humans will either be part of it, or the planet will go on without us.
 In other words, itâ€™s defossilize or die. But where others see a dire choice, LanzaTech sees a trillion-dollar opportunity.
 The good news is after 15 years, north of a thousand patents, 
 and millions of hours of pioneering scientific inquiry, LanzaTech has invented a technology big enough to meet the moment. One that transforms pollution into profit, and ensures that humans continue to prosper far into the post-pollution future.
 The science is state-of-the-art, but the idea is simple. 
 We use nature to heal nature. First we capture carbon emissions. Then we feed them into bioreactors where trillions of carbon-hungry microbes go to work. These tiny dynamos eat the pollution and output valuable raw material commodities. Pure enough to be resold, repurposed, recycled, renewed, re-everythinged â€” from sustainable jet fuel to yoga pants.
 
 Itâ€™s a commercial scale solution thatâ€™s ready for market today. In a crowded sector filled with speculation but short on results, our plug-and-play platform is already making our customers money. Turns out science and business makes one helluva team.
 Waste carbon pollution is humanityâ€™s biggest threat. 
 LanzaTech is turning it into an opportunity. Reducing emissions and making money for our customers â€” today. 
 Let's transform our tired Lose-Lose climate debate into a Win-Win proposition. One that helps companies grow their revenue while helping the planet reach a post-pollution reality.

  hospital discharge reduces readmission rate by ~25%

 At Snap, weâ€™ve harnessed the power of data to empower customers of all credit types and to help retailers close more sales. Our technology brings together machine learning, non-traditional risk variables, and years of data to create a proprietary decisioning platform. The result is financing that looks at each customer through a more holistic, human lens.

 CIS offers all three International Baccalaureate programmes, from Primary Years through to the Diploma Programme. The CIS curriculum is benchmarked against national curricula globally, allowing students to successfully transition to any other school if and when required, or to graduate and be admitted to leading universities anywhere in the world. To date, over 180 universities globally have offered places to CIS graduates. 
 
 Faculty adopt a student-centric approach which ensures that programme development, curriculum and assessment are driven by what is best for children and their learning, across the K-12 spectrum. This student-centricity manifests itself in pioneering programmes and learning spaces that simulate the real world, provoke inquiry and investigation, analysis and experimentation, collaboration and communication, and innovation and creativity.
 
 At CIS, students are taught how to think, not what to think. Students are taught to become flexible and critical thinkers, creative in the way that they connect ideas and concepts, collaborative in their thinking and inspirational in their capacity to motivate others. They collaborate, they connect with the community and environment around them, and they search for solutions rather than look for the one â€˜rightâ€™ answer. They are encouraged to build on their natural curiosity and develop strong communication skills that will enable them to connect with people both on a local and global level.

Itâ€™s a pretty safe bet to say that weâ€™re cheese obsessed: our goal is to find the most delicious cheese across the globe, and then feed it to you!
 
 
 
 Murray was a Jewish veteran of the Spanish Civil War who was rumored to be a Communist â€“ but pay no mind, he was a smart capitalist who built a great reputation for the business. In the 70s, Murray sold the shop to his clerk Louis Tudda, an Italian immigrant from Calabria. In those days, it was a humble butter and eggs shop that had a lot of block cheeses and catered to the little Italian enclave that Bleecker Street was at the time.
 
 
 
 Rob Kaufelt bought the Murrayâ€™s in the early 90s and began traveling the globe, finding new cheeses that no one had ever heard of and bringing them back to the US. He and our lucky team travel regularly both in Europe and across the US in search of the new and great artisan cheeses being produced from California to Vermont and from Athens to Wales. And everywhere in between.
 
 
 
 The main thing that makes Murrayâ€™s special is our passion for cheese â€“ we share that with our friends and customers, whether youâ€™re visiting one of our shops in New York, stopping by a Murrayâ€™s kiosk at your local supermarket, trolling on our web site, taking a class with us, or working with our wholesale department for your restaurant.",-1,4,9,221,1379566

It is considered a leader and innovator in mental health, and it is the only organization providing comprehensive mental health services to residents of Boulder and Broomfield counties regardless of their ability to pay.
 
 Today, the organization serves over 21,000 individuals each year and responds to nearly 13,000 calls to emergency psychiatric services annually. MHP employs over 400 dedicated administrative and mental health professionalsâ€”including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and peer support specialists. Our team of licensed therapists and support team members are experts in their fields, bringing a wide array of knowledge and diversity to the individuals they serve. 
 
 MHP runs 20+ distinct programs from 9 service locations across Boulder and Broomfield counties, and engages more than 100 community partners including schools, healthcare clinics, nonprofits, local agencies, and businesses.

 The mission of U.S. Kids Golf is to help kids have fun learning the lifelong game of golf and to encourage family interaction that builds lasting memories.
 
 OUR HISTORY
 U.S. Kids Golf, LLC is based in Atlanta and manufactures equipment and related golf products designed for kids. It was created in 1996 when Founder/CEO Dan Van Horn found that his children were losing interest in golf due to not having the proper equipment. â€œThey were enthusiastic at first, but their interest quickly dropped. They weren't having fun,""â€‹ Van Horn recalls. At the time, I didn't realize that cutoffs and junior clubs were so heavy; they were not only hurting my kids'â€‹ swings, but also their desire to play.""â€‹
 
 That's when the former golf professional and engineer began developing Ultralight kids clubs, which were designed to be 25% lighter than adult and most junior clubs, and he formed the company, U.S. Kids Golf. Since then, parents and pros around the world have seen the incredible difference that lightweight and correctly fit clubs have made in their young player's swing and enthusiasm for the game. Today, the company is the worldâ€™s leading provider of equipment.
  
 The U.S. Kids Golf Foundation, a Georgia non-profit recognized as a 501(c)(3) public charity, was created in 2001 and provides services that include competition and instruction. The Foundation organizes more than 1,300 golf tournaments for kids each year with over 15,000 unique players ages 5-18.
  
 Included are Local Tours in over 60 cities worldwide, 10 U.S.â€“based Regional Championships, seven international multi-day tournaments which includes the prestigious European Championship, and the pinnacle events held each year in Pinehurst, North Carolina, the U.S. Kids Golf World Championship and Teen World Championship.

 In 2007, David and Lisa Rock and their team had been working in leadership development and executive coaching for ten years, when David coined the term â€œNeuroLeadership.â€ They realized that bringing a more concrete, science-based approach to growing soft skills would not just resonate with business leaders but also make any change initiative more effective.
 
 That same year, what would become the NeuroLeadership Institute ran its first Summit in Asolo, Italy, convening business practitioners and brain scientists. Since then, Summits have been held across London, Sydney, San Francisco, DC and Boston before settling into its home in New York City. Tens of thousands of people now join the summit each year by live streaming.
 
 2008 also saw the launch of the NeuroLeadership Journal.
 
 In its first few years, NLI published the foundational papers in the field, including the first paper on the SCARF Â® Model. We initially provided executive education, and then soon started to consult with firms based on demand, eventually helping launch a movement to do performance management without formal ratings.
 
 After two and a half years of research, NLI launched the SEEDS Model Â® in 2015, and a diversity and inclusion (D&I) practice was born. Soon after, NLI launched a culture and leadership practice, initially working with tech giants Intel, Microsoft, and IBM. It also gained deep expertise in growth mindset and helped many organizations transform culture. Around that same time, NLI introduced the distributed learning solution, a socialized learning methodology that allows large groups of people to learn and retain knowledge with little time commitment.

 Traditionally, the process of liquidating returns has been a slow and labor-intensive process, with retailers and manufacturers often having to rely on traditional wholesale channels or liquidation companies to dispose of their excess inventory. This can be a time-consuming and costly process, with retailers and manufacturers often having to accept low prices for their goods.
 
 Nellis Auction, however, is changing all of that by using cutting-edge technology and advanced auctioning strategies to quickly and efficiently liquidate returns. The company utilizes an online auction platform to reach a wide local audience of buyers, which allows them to achieve higher prices for the goods we are selling.
 
 In addition to these technological innovations, Nellis Auction also provides a range of value-added services to help retailers and manufacturers better manage their returns.",26,76,113,134,2899299

 We believe broadening the application of the tools of financial analysis to every aspect of business operations is one of the great unleveraged business opportunities of our time. The reach of finance should extend beyond compliance fulfillment reporting and incrementalist budgeting activity to the critical analysis of operating areas outside the finance function. In addressing these opportunities, our team applies focus, objectivity and superior academic and professional credentials.

Founded out of MIT in 2013, Superpedestrian develops technologies for micro-electric vehicles that optimize safety, reliability, and performance. 
 
 Superpedestrian spent over 4 years developing its proprietary Vehicle Intelligence System (VIS), which was first introduced in the companyâ€™s consumer product, the Copenhagen Wheel. Since 2018, Superpedestrian has focused its efforts on engineering and validating its new electric scooter for shared fleets. In 2020, the company launched its vehicles under the brand name LINK. 
 
 Featuring the mature VIS platform, Superpedestrianâ€™s fleet scooter can detect and protect against more than 100 common malfunctions. This platform of embedded computers and cloud software enables Superpedestrianâ€™s scooters to autonomously protect from damage during and between rides. Within nanoseconds, the scooters can detect potential problems such as battery fires, short circuits, or failed brakes, and take corrective action to avert damage. 
 
 Vehicle Intelligence prevents over 50% of issues that would cause other scooters to fail, and streamlines operations if issues arise. If the scooter canâ€™t protect itself, it automatically becomes unavailable for rental and generates a detailed service ticket for repair. The result is a substantial improvement in vehicle safety for scooter riders and major cost savings for fleet operators.

 We started Marshmallow when we found out how unfair insurance prices are for people who move to the UK. Purely because the industry hasnâ€™t given this huge cohort of people a secondâ€™s thought, and isnâ€™t set up to price them properly. 
 So far, weâ€™ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Weâ€™ve done this by building our own technology, developing pricing and fraud models that let us cater to their unique experiences, and investing time in getting to know them.
 
 So whatâ€™s next? 
 
 We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies arenâ€™t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. Solving important problems for the people who need it most.

Living in Seattle, she fell in love with Pike Place Market with its inspiring blend of products, artisans, and farmers. To her, it was a special gathering place for food lovers and culinary visionaries alike. 
 
 When Shirley opened her first store in Pike Place Market, she was determined to assemble the best selection of cookware, gadgets, linens and booksâ€”even importing exclusive specialty items from France, her favorite culinary destination. Using the market as her inspiration, she thoughtfully filled her store with cooking tools that would bring people together in the kitchen and around the table. This sense of connection and love of French cuisine inspired the name Sur La Table, which simply means â€œon the table.â€

 The Thames Tideway Tunnel is a 25 kilometre interception, storage and transfer tunnel running up to 65 metres below the river.
 
 Starting in west London, the main tunnel generally follows the route of the River Thames to Limehouse, where it then continues north-east to Abbey Mills Pumping Station near Stratford. There it will be connected to the Lee Tunnel, which will transfer the sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.
 
 Overflows of untreated sewage into the River Thames add up to tens of millions of tonnes every year.
 
 London's sewerage system relies on an integrated network of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). At the time it was built, the CSOs would release flows through discharge points along the river during heavy storms. Originally, this would happen once or twice a year, it now happens on a weekly basis and no longer requires a storm to trigger overflows.
 
 By intercepting the sewage before it enters the river, the Thames Tideway Tunnel will help prevent the River Thames from being polluted with untreated sewage which can stay in the river for up to three months before the ebb and flow of the tide finally takes it out to sea.

 Unsere Geschichte
 
 Seit seiner Erfindung im frÃ¼hen 19. Jahrhundert fasziniert das Fahrrad Jung und Alt. Auf zwei RÃ¤dern bewegen wir uns unabhÃ¤ngig und frei. Wir nehmen die Umgebung neu wahr â€“ wach, mit allen Sinnen. 
 
 Unvergessliche Momente. Radfahren lernen heisst neue Welten erkunden, das erste eigene Fahrrad ist eine Sternstunde im Leben und irgendwann wird das kostbare Highend-Bike zum ganzen Stolz.
 
 Auch die erste Fahrt auf einem E-Bike ist unvergesslich.
 
 Diese Faszination beflÃ¼gelte in den frÃ¼hen 1990ern eine Handvoll passionierter Techniker und TÃ¼ftler. Sie waren getrieben von der Idee, Fahrradtechnologie mit elektrischer Energie neu zu definieren. Mit Schweizer PrÃ¤zision und hÃ¶chsten QualitÃ¤tsansprÃ¼chen machten sich die Pioniere ans Werk und bauten schon bald die ersten FLYER E-Bikes.
 
 Heute kann FLYER auf einen enormen Erfahrungsschatz zurÃ¼ckgreifen. Unser Know-how prÃ¤gt alles, was wir tun. Als leidenschaftliche E-Biker sind wir am liebsten draussen unterwegs â€“ hoch in den Schweizer Alpen, in den HÃ¼geln rund um unser Werk und mitten in der Stadt.

 Currently, we are working on two major projects: Exoborne â€“ a Sharkmob original game created in MalmÃ¶, is a tactical, open-world extraction shooter set in a United States torn apart by apocalyptic forces of nature. The second project, developed in London, is another Sharkmob original IP yet to be announced. Our first game Bloodhunt - a battle royale set in the Vampire: The Masquerade universe, was released on 27 April 2022. 
  
 We are fortunate to work with things we are passionate about and we have the privilege of creating entertainment for others to enjoy. We believe that if we have fun making games, people will have fun playing them. Fun is also about daring to do mighty things that allow us to reach levels of achievement we otherwise can't. All things said we want a fun, professional experience & so we all must lead by example.
 
 We want everyone to feel like they have a stake in the games we make. Our games are not the brainchild of a few people - we own them together. Everyoneâ€™s contributions, opinions, and feedback matter. For this to work everyone needs to respect the big picture and high-level goals of the project. Shared ownership is at the heart of the Sharkmob adventure.
 
 We embrace a system of ""disagree and commit"". This means that we accept that we might not always get our way but we wholeheartedly support decisions we make as a team. Doing more with less and making an extra effort to find the optimal way forward is always valued. We rely on smart decisions to take us further than otherwise possible.

 Allow us to clarify some common misconceptions:
 1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.
 2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).
 3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.

 We started Marshmallow when we found out how unfair insurance prices are for people who move to the UK. Purely because the industry hasnâ€™t given this huge cohort of people a secondâ€™s thought, and isnâ€™t set up to price them properly. 
 So far, weâ€™ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Weâ€™ve done this by building our own technology, developing pricing and fraud models that let us cater to their unique experiences, and investing time in getting to know them.
 
 So whatâ€™s next? 
 
 We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies arenâ€™t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. Solving important problems for the people who need it most.

 In 1952, the sons of Sheikh Hamad; Abdulaziz, Mohammed and Abdullatif, carried on his legacy and embarked on a journey into the world of commerce with the establishment of a small company trading in foodstuffs. Since then, the company has grown into a sophisticated corporation, with interests and endeavors in a number of widely differentiated businesses. This growth was hinted at when the company first launched into international activity back in 1956, in the city of Al-Khobar.

We embrace change if it means streamlining a process, modifying a product or adjusting a timeline that will improve our customersâ€™ experience as a whole. Itâ€™s this agility that allows our different departments to adapt quickly and work effectively amongst themselves and with each other.

The demand for his chicken was so great that it wasnâ€™t unusual for him to out sell everything by noon each day and already had people placing orders for the next day. It quickly became a successful concept and soon Pollo Regio moved into a regular storefront. A few years later, Hector J. Rodriguez became part of the company and Chief Executive Officer.

Our mission is to inspire those people to take action, empower them to change their world for the better, and connect them so they can achieve more together than they can alone.
 
 We were founded by community organizers, so when we seek change, we do it by bringing people together. 
 
 That approach begins at home, on the South Side of Chicago, where we are building the Obama Presidential Center. The Center represents a historic opportunity for Chicago: a chance to build a world-class museum and public gathering space that celebrates our nationâ€™s first African American President and First Lady, steps away from where he began his career, where she was raised, and whereâ€”togetherâ€”they made their home. 
 
 But that approach extends to all our work, whether itâ€™s holding leadership training sessions in communities throughout the U.S., bringing local leaders together in countries around the world, working to support the global education of girls, or ensuring young men of color have pathways to opportunity.

Since then, they've taken a process that has been dominated by recruiters and phone calls and turned that into a a fully digital experience, connecting nurses directly to job opportunities and facilitating everything that needs to happen in betweenâ€”including handling benefits, payroll, onboarding, and compliance. Their platform also provides full employer-of-record services for employers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
  
 In 2020, they launched their proprietary staffing platform, Works (www.works.ai).

With Works, facilities can create their own on-demand nursing workforce and access one source of truth for all of their clinical workforce needs, from sourcing and onboarding to ongoing compliance. With predictive insights and recommendations, Works helps hospitals easily react to fluctuations in demand, while its staffing marketplace creates competition to fill open job requisitions with high-quality, active talent from a pre-onboarded network of talent suppliers.

 Pathstream was borne out of the observation that nearly all jobs increasingly require digital skills, specifically â€œplatform-centricâ€ skills on software platforms such as Adobe, Unity, Autodesk, Facebook Ads, etc. However, these high power, in-demand software platforms are hard to learn through the passive, video-based instructional approach of most online learning.

As a result, students graduate with the skills they need to be desirable in the job market and begin adding value from their first day of hire.

 From our humble beginnings in 1963 when Manny and Richard Schwartz opened one of the first shower door manufacturers in Long Island, New York. At the time, tempered or safety glass was relatively unknown in the industry and most shower doors were made with wire and/or laminate glass that had to be manually cut and fitted for the framed shower door. 
 
 Through the '70s & '80s, business thrived throughout the New England area and grew into a regional brand. After his retirement in the '90's, Manny's sons carried the family business forward, with Michael leading the original Long Island location and Steve leading a national growth plan by opening additional manufacturing facilities, tempering plants and distribution in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Virginia.

 At the heart of the NuScale power plant is the NuScale Power Moduleâ„¢ (NPM), a small modular reactor (SMR) that brings together traditional componentsâ€”the reactor vessel, steam generator, pressurizer, and containmentâ€”into a single, simplified, and fully factory-fabricated unit. Each NPM can produce 77 megawatts of electricity (MWe), and one NuScale plant can house up to 12 NPMs for a total of 924 MWe (gross). This scalability feature is unique to NuScale and allows for customization of facility output to match demand and project economics.
 
 NuScale has achieved a paradigm shift in the level of safety of a nuclear power plant facilityâ€”safety comes first, second to none. NuScaleâ€™s Triple Crown for Nuclear Plant Safetyâ„¢ design ensures that on loss of all electricity to the power station, an undesirable situation for other nuclear plant designs, each NPM will safely shut down and self-cool, indefinitely, with no need for operator or computer action, AC or DC power, or additional water. This capability is a first for commercial nuclear power.

As the worldâ€™s first refillable drinking system that flavors water through scent alone: itâ€™s a hydration revolution. 
 
 What's meant by this? Science shows that the majority of what we perceive as flavor is actually derived from scents. Our one-of-a-kind drinking system transports carefully-crafted flavors from our pods through the mouth all the way to your olfactory receptors - and that's when your brain perceives the scent as flavor. This is called â€œretronasal olfactionâ€ - just drinking water, but perceiving it as a flavored beverage. Mind-blowing, we know. But itâ€™s just science.* 
 
 Since its launch in Europe in July 2019, air upÂ® has grown into a company that operates in over 11 countries, has more than 300 employees, and enjoys a customer base in the millions.
